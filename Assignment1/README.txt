I Implemented the jello cube physics function
1. it can act like a jello cube, bouncing back from the wall.
2. hook damping collision works fine
3.I have tested the force field, it works fine, you can test it using some word file.

I Implemented the inlined plane collision and interaction.
1. you can put in any given a,b,c,d all works fine with the cube.
2. I use dot matrix to show the surface of the plane cause I donâ€™t know how to implement it in polygon.

1. drag mouse in left click, up and down, giving the cube a up and down force.
2. drag mouse in left click, left and right, giving the cube a left and right force.
